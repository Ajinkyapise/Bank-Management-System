# Bank-Management-System
The Bank Management System is a software application developed using Java programming language. It provides a convenient way for managing various banking operations such as creating customer accounts, managing transactions, and generating reports. MySQL is used as the database management system to store and retrieve data efficiently.

**Features**
Customer Management: The system allows the creation and management of customer accounts. It enables the bank staff to perform tasks such as adding new customers, updating customer details, and deleting customer accounts.

Account Management: Bank staff can manage various types of accounts, including savings accounts, current accounts, and fixed deposit accounts. They can create new accounts, close existing accounts, and update account information.

Transaction Management: The system enables the recording and tracking of transactions performed by customers. It supports deposit, withdrawal, transfer, and balance inquiry operations. The transaction history is maintained for each customer account.

Interest Calculation: The system calculates interest for savings accounts and fixed deposit accounts based on predefined interest rates and compounding intervals.

Report Generation: Reports such as customer account statements, transaction history, and interest calculation summaries can be generated. These reports provide valuable information for auditing and analysis purposes.

**Technologies Used**
The Bank Management System is built using the following technologies:

Java: The core programming language used to develop the system.
MySQL: The database management system employed for storing and retrieving data.
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC): JDBC is utilized to establish a connection between the Java application and the MySQL database.
Java Swing: Swing is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application, providing a user-friendly experience.
Installation
To set up the Bank Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system, if not already installed.

Install MySQL database server and set up a MySQL user account with appropriate privileges.

Create a new database in MySQL for the Bank Management System.

Download the source code files of the Bank Management System from the repository.

Open the project in your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Update the database connection details in the code to match your MySQL configuration (e.g., hostname, port, username, password, and database name).

Build and run the application from your IDE.

The Bank Management System should now be up and running on your local machine.

**Usage**
Upon launching the Bank Management System, you will be presented with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to perform various banking operations. The interface will provide options to create customer accounts, manage accounts, perform transactions, and generate reports.

Follow the on-screen instructions and provide the necessary inputs to carry out the desired operations. The system will interact with the MySQL database to store and retrieve data as required.
